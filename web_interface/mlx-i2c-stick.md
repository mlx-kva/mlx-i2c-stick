## Introduction

Yet another I2C interface...  
However `mlx-i2c-stick` aims to:  
- Provide a low cost interface towards our 3.3V supplied sensors who uses the I2C communication bus.
- Use as much as possbile off-the-shelf available material/modules.
- Create a friction free getting starting experience. 
- Enable prototyping using its small sensor boards.
- Provide a reference `code` (firmware) based on the arduino platform; snippets can be used in end-user-applications.

## What is mlx-i2c-stick?

A microcontroller with on one hand a USB CDC UART and on the other a I2C master at 3.3V.  
We provide open source firmware and an userinterface to easily get started with our I2C/3.3V based sensors.

## Getting started

1. Click the `open` button on the top right of the screen.
1. Select the serial port of the mlx-i2c-stick.
1. Enable the chart (transient or spatial)
1. The `Scan` button will scan the I2C bus for slaves
1. The `Start` button will start continiously measuring all recognised slaves
1. The `Stop` button will stop continiously measuring the slaves
1. The slaves will appear on the left column.
1. The `MV` button will initiate a singlee 'Measure Values' action.
1. The terminal let you do other cool stuff, more on this later.

### Melexis Sensor board Hardware

Our sensors boards minimizes the board size to the bare minimum while we maximize the capability to use the sensor boards in a prototype by having the sensor mounted at opposite site as the connector and other components.
